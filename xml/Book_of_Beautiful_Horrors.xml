If drunk by a living creature, the creature instantly falls unconscious for 8 hours and age by 1d4 years. During its sleep the creature has the most vivid erotic dreams, more realistic than life and fulfilling all its darkest fantasies. When it wakes up, the creature remembers the dreams perfectly and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, gaining a level of exhaustion on failure. </text>		<text>	 </text>		<text></text>		<text>	 </text>		<text>&#8226; Curse: The dreams induced by the wine are so intense that reality pales to compare, letting the cursed creature eternally unsatisfied. Until the curse is removed the creature gains a form of indefinite madness "I'll do everything I can to relive these dreams again".</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Book of Beautiful Horrors, p. 47</text>	</item>

	<item>		<name>Eerie Pipe</name>		<type>W</type>		<magic>1</magic>		<weight></weight>		<text>This singular looking pipe is carved in the ribcage bones of a child. When used by any other creature than a grave hag it acts as a pipe of the sewers, but when in the hands of the hag, it reveals new powers. The hag can play an eerie tune from the pipe as an action, expanding a charge and creating the following effects: </text>		<text>	 </text>		<text>&#8226; The tune can only be heard by humanoid children and creatures with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. Only humanoid children are affected by the eerie pipe. Children that are deafened, cannot be charmed or can&#8217;t be put to sleep with magic are immune to the pipe&#8217;s effects. </text>		<text>	 </text>		<text>&#8226; While the pipe is played, all children within half a mile of it (as determined by the DM) are called. Called children move toward the music by the shortest available route. </text>		<text>	 </text>		<text>&#8226; Whenever children come within 30 feet of the hag while it plays the pipes, the children are swayed by the pipes' music and become charmed, acting friendly toward the hag for as long as it continue to play the pipes each round as an action. Charmed children obey the hag&#8217;s commands, even if they are obviously suicidal (&#8220;jump by that cliff, walk in this river...&#8221;). If no command is issued to a charmed child, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a charmed child starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, it is no longer charmed and behaves as it normally would. After that the child can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Book of Beautiful Horrors, p. 13</text>	</item>

While the item is in her possession she can use her Command Undead feature. Only the grave hag who crafted the hand of glory can use its power. Crafting a hand of glory takes 30 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose hand is used to craft the item).</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Book of Beautiful Horrors, p. 12</text>	</item>
	<item>		<name>Restless Eye</name>		<type>W</type>		<magic>1</magic>		<detail>rare, cursed (requires attunement)</detail>		<weight></weight>		<text>This fleshy, evil-looking eye is the Third Eye of a fallen morvudd or chort. The eye merges with your forehead, blinking and staring independently from your eyes. The eye has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the eyebite spell at DC 15 from it. Additionally you gain proficiency with the Wisdom (Perception) skill or gain advantage on this roll if you are already proficient. </text>		<text>	 </text>		<text>Curse: The eye is cursed: a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the eye or you attune to it. Attuning to the eye curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic; extracting the eye &#8212; a dangerous operation &#8212; fails to end the curse. While cursed, if you have a neutral or good alignment, each long rest you must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw, suffering from a short-term madness (p. 259 of the Dungeon Master Manual) on a failed save. If the save fails by 5 or more, you also suffer from a long-term madness. The short-term and long-term madnesses can be ended with the greater restoration spell or similar magic.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Book of Beautiful Horrors, p. 24</text>	</item>
	<item>		<name>Unicorn Salts</name>		<type>W</type>		<magic>1</magic>		<detail>uncommon (requires attunement)</detail>		<weight></weight>		<text>While wearing the pouch around your neck you are hidden from divination magic from fey creatures of evil alignment. You can't be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors. A fey creature of evil alignment who targets you with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This effect doesn&#8217;t protect you from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball. You are immune to the memory loss induced by the spectral hunt and the Feywild.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Book of Beautiful Horrors, p. 81</text>	</item>
